    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 response has been largely regional and state-based in nature. Some states have enacted strictly enforced stay-at-home policies, while others have provided guidelines. Now, some states are rapidly moving to reopen while others are following scientific guidelines and moving towards reopening very deliberately.   \n",
    "While data concerning the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths has been reported for each state and analyzed based on the states' policies on social distancing, little information is known about the relationship between those features and individuals' sentiments about the pandemic.  \n",
    "To get a full picture of the U.S.'s response to the coronavirus,  there is a need to look at the sentiment analysis of social media posts across geographic regions and compare them to both the local policies on social distancing and the occurrences of the pandemic in those areas.  \n",
    "In order to fill this information gap, we will map the sentiment score based on tweets related to Covid-19 posted between April 28th and May 6th, 2020 accross U.S states.     \n",
    "In order to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between sentiment and location, we will compare the sentiment of residents in New York and Texas, two large states on opposite ends of the political spectrum which have acted very differently in terms of the crises.  \n",
    "More specifically, we will build and interpret a Linear Regression model using Covid-19 occurences and state policy information to predict the sentiment score of NY and Texas residents. "
