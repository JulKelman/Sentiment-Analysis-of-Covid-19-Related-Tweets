    "Previously I was using my own trained LSTM model to find out the overall sentiment of tweets. However, the model was still in pre-alpha phase. Therefore, instead of sharing out the score computed by the model, I decided to just append the sentiment score coming out of TextBlob. The scores have been computed by TB on default settings. If you'd need to reach out to me in future regarding the project, feel free to email me. Good luck with your project."
